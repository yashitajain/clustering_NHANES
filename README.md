Clustering analysis for macronutrient variables such as fat, protein and carbohydrates intake of subjects from different ethnic groups. 
We have used K-prot clustering algorithm, an extension of K-means to be able to use for numeric as well as character variables. 

The data has been taken from NHANES and the dietary and demongraphic dataset has been merged. 

<b>merge_no_missing_values.csv </b> is the merged data from NHANES and has no missing values. 

<b>k_prot.py </b>is the python code gives clusters for different levels of macronutrients of different ethnic groups. 

<b>final_poster.pptx </b> is the results of the clustering analysis.
